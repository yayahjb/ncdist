                        Herbert J. Bernstein and Lawrence C. Andrews
                                Version 1.1.0 07 Jun 2019
                                     rev 22 Jun 2020

                                    yayahjb@gmail.com


ncdist is a package of utilities built on the Niggli-Cone cell distance discussed in 
[Andrews, L. C.,  Bernstein, H. J. (2014). "The geometry of Niggli reduction: BGAOL -- 
embedding Niggli reduction and analysis of boundaries". J. Appl. Cryst. 
47(1), 346 -- 359.] which provides a sensitive and reliable metric for the distance between
crystallographic unit cells.  Subsequent work has shown that similar distances can be
computed more efficiently based on Selling reduction which is the basis for Delaunay
reduction [Andrews, L. C., Bernstein, H. J. and Sauter, N. K. (2019). "Selling reduction 
versus Niggli reduction for crystallographic lattices". Acta Cryst. A75(1), 115 -- 120.]
[Andrews, L. C., Bernstein, H. J. and Sauter, N. K. (2019). "A space for lattice 
representation and clustering". Acta Cryst. A75(3), 593 -- 599.  Four shell command line 
programs, ncdist, d7dist, s6dist_app, and cs6dist_app are provided as well as
a shared libraries, rcpp_ncdist (librcpp_ncdist.so), rcpp_d7dist (librcpp_d7dist.so),
rcpp_s6dist (librcpp_s6dist.so),  and rcpp_cs6dist (librcpp_cs6dist.so),  for use from R.

The 1.1.0 release of 7 Jun 2019 has been refactored to use code from L. C. Andrews
Lattice Representation Library (https://github.com/duck10/LatticeRepLib.git) with
changes to adapt to the conventions of the ncdist code.

Work on the upgrade to version 1.1.0 has been supported in part by funding from the US 
Department of Energy Offices of Biological and Environmental Research and of Basic Energy 
Sciences (grant No. DE-AC02-98CH10886 ; grant No. E-SC0012704); U.S. National Institutes 
of Health (grant No. P41RR012408; grant No. P41GM103473; grant No. P41GM111244; and grant 
No. R01GM117126 ); Dectris, Ltd.

  cs6dist lat1 a1 b1 c1 alpha1 beta1 gamma1 lat2 a2 b2 c2 alpha2 beta2 gamma2

lat1 and lat2 are centering symbols
  P (Primitive)
  A (a-centered)
  B (b-centered)
  C (c-centered)
  F (all-faces-centered)
  I (body-centered)
  R (rhombohedral as hexagonal)

a1, b1, c1, a2, b2, c2 are cell edge length in Angstroms
alpha1, beta1, gamma1, alpha2, beta2, gamma2 are cell angles in degrees

A timed call to ncdist on a 12-core AMD threadripper will produce

Which says the NCdist distance between these two cells if 2.6182 Angstroms, computed
as 0.1 times the square root of the G6 distance in Angstroms^2.  At present the
extra information above the distance is provided to facilitate debugging and will
be made optional in a future version.

THE RCPP INTERFACE TO NCDIST

The libraries rcpp_ncdist, rcpp_d7dist, rcpp_s6dist, and rcpp_cs6dist are provided as 
an interface between R and ncdist.  Depending on the type of system used, the name of 
the file may be a .dylib, a .dll, a .so and may or may not be prefixed by lib.  Under 
linux the names are librcpp_ncdist.so, librcpp_d7dist.so, librcpp_s6dist.so, and 
librcpp_cs6dist.so.  Under OS X the names are usually librcpp_ncdist.dylib, 
librcpp_ncdist.dylib,librcpp_s6dist.dylib, and librcpp_cs6dist.dylib

Assuming the library is named /usr/local/lib/librcpp_ncdist.so , in order to compute 
a cell distance in R, the commands are:

> library("Rcpp")
> dyn.load("/usr/local/lib/librcpp_ncdist.so")
> .Call("rcpp_ncdist", "P", 100, 100, 100, 90, 90, 90, "P", 99, 99, 99, 89, 89, 89)

which will return

[1] 2.618197

INSTALLATION

Preliminaries:  You need a development system with cmake, C, C++, Fortran, R, Rcpp, 
RcppParallel and RcppArmadillo installed.

Download the package from https://github.com/yayahjb/ncdist.git

If you downloaded as a zip, unpack the kit.  In any case if you have the source in
ncdist

cd ncdist/build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<prefix> ..
make all
make install

will install the kit in <prefix>, specifically, it will 

install ncdist in <prefix>/bin/ncdist
install librcpp_ncdist in <prefix>/lib/librcpp_ncdist.<shared_library_extension>
install license.txt in <prefix>/share/ncdist/license.txt

In most cases you will want <prefix> to be $CCP4
